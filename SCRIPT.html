was worried.
</P>
<p>
Sharma:You are very lucky,you have a son who will take after you and achieve greatness.
</p>
<p>
Gopal:I am lucky indeed,But my main worry is after I die ,I don't know who to trust to give my son all my fortune.
</p>
<p>
Sharma:Wouldn't the safest thing be to bury all the gold and money in a secure place in the forest.
</p>
<p>
Gopal:Yes,indeed my friend.
</p>
<p>
Narrator:Gopal accompanied with two of his servants Raj and Malik went to the forest and dug his gold under a palm tree.After a few
months Gopal died.Many years later his son Nanda,now a young man met his father's friend Sharma.
</p>
<p>
Nanda:My father was a rich man but there doesn't seem to be enough money to manage the estate.
</p>
<p>
Sharma:He did leave a huge amount of money for you son,He wasn't sure who to trust to give it to you.So,he burried it,Raj and Malik know
about it.
</p>
<p>
Narrator:He asked Raj and Malik to take him there,but as soon as soon as they reached the palm tree,both of them started shouting
at him at once.
</p>
<p>
Raj:You idiot,what do you think of finding here.
</p>
<p>
Malik:There is no treasure here,we are going on a fool's quest.
</p>
<p>
Narrator:Nanda was supprised the people who had been docile for many years were suddenly pouncing on him.But he decided to ignore them and 
said:
</p>
<p>
Nanda:Alright then let us go.
</p>
<p>
Narrator:He took them to the same point many times but as soon as they reached the palm tree the started acting brashly.So he asked 
for Sharma's help.
</p>
<p>
Sharma:You said they were acting strangely as soon as they reach the palm tree.This is the place where your father burried the gold.
</p>
<p>
Nanda:How do you know?
</p>
<p>
Sharma:Money corrupts people,whenever the reach the site they turn into different men,Go again tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Narrator:So he took them to the site again.
</p>
<p>
Raj:you pathetic idiot what do you think of accomplishing here!
</p>
<p>
Malik:You bring us here every day what do you want you fool!
</p>
<p>
Narrator:Nanda angrily clasped their throats and said...
</p>
<p>
Nanda:Who do you think you are talking to!
</p>
<p>
Narrator:He asked them to stand right there and he started digging himself and found two golden chests.He ordered them to carry them to 
his house.And from that day both Malik and Raj worked for him faithfully.
